# time-series-analysis-econometrics

This project demonstrates a variety of econometric analysis and forecasting models utilizing real-world data. Various tests were performed to inform whether a model was a good fit for a particular dataset, or what decompositions must be performed to make the dataset amenable to the model. Datasets leaned heavily toward finance and economics.
