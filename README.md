# time-series-analysis-econometrics

In this project I tracked down the most comprehensive US stock/bond return data in existence to address the question: what allocation of stocks / bonds should a person include in their retirement portfolio? 

Credit to Edward McQuarrie for making it possible to include an astonishing 230 years of market returns in this project. Unlike most analyses which track the S&P500 back to the 1860s, we were able to see trends going all the way back to 1793 - George Washington's term as our first president!
